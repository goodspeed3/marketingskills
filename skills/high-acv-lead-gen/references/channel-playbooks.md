# Channel Playbooks for High-ACV Lead Generation

Detailed execution guides for each pipeline channel referenced in the main skill.

## 1. Outbound Sequences (Cold Email + Multi-Channel)

### When to Use
- You have identified contacts within target accounts
- No existing relationship or warm path exists
- Need to create awareness and urgency where none exists

### Sequence Architecture

**The 3-Value-Set Model:**

Each sequence tests three different angles. If the first value proposition doesn't resonate, the second might. This prevents burning contacts on a single message.

```
VALUE SET 1: Primary Pain Point (Days 1-7)
├── Day 1: Cold email — observation + pain + low-friction CTA
├── Day 2: LinkedIn connection request (no pitch in note)
├── Day 4: Email 2 — share relevant resource (report, benchmark, article)
├── Day 6: Reply bump — reference the resource, ask if relevant
└── Day 7: LinkedIn engage — comment on their content or company news

VALUE SET 2: Different Angle (Days 10-16)
├── Day 10: Email 3 — NEW subject line, different pain point
├── Day 11: Voicemail — reference the email ("I sent you something yesterday")
├── Day 13: Email 4 — case study or proof point relevant to this angle
└── Day 15: Reply bump — reference case study, restate CTA

VALUE SET 3: Business Outcome (Days 19-25)
├── Day 19: Email 5 — frame around business outcome, not product
├── Day 21: LinkedIn message — direct, brief, reference prior outreach
├── Day 23: Email 6 — breakup or "one last thing" with calendar link
└── Day 25: Final LinkedIn engage or skip
```

### Sequence Weaving Technique

Each touch references previous touches to create a cohesive narrative:
- **Email → Voicemail**: "I sent you an email yesterday about X"
- **Voicemail → LinkedIn**: "Left you a voicemail — wanted to connect here too"
- **LinkedIn → Email**: "Noticed you accepted my connection — wanted to share this"

This makes outreach feel persistent but deliberate, not random.

### Cold Email Templates (High-ACV)

**Template 1: Observation-Led**
```
Subject: [Specific thing you noticed about their company]

[First name], noticed [specific observation about their business —
a recent hire, product launch, strategic move, or public statement].

Companies in [their situation] typically struggle with [pain point],
which leads to [business consequence].

We helped [similar company] [specific outcome with numbers].

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this is relevant?
```

**Template 2: Trigger Event**
```
Subject: [Trigger event reference]

[First name], saw [trigger event — funding round, executive hire,
acquisition, regulation, expansion].

When [companies in their segment] go through this, [pain point]
usually becomes urgent because [reason].

[One sentence about how you help with this specific scenario.]

Open to a quick conversation this week?
```

**Template 3: Case Study / Social Proof**
```
Subject: How [similar company] solved [their problem]

[First name], [similar company in their industry/segment] was
dealing with [specific problem].

[One sentence on what they did differently.]

[Quantified result — revenue, time saved, risk reduced.]

Happy to share the details if you are seeing something similar.
```

**Template 4: Breakup**
```
Subject: Re: [previous subject line]

[First name], I have reached out a few times — I know you are busy.

If [pain point] is not a priority right now, totally understand.
I will close the loop on my end.

If it becomes relevant later, here is my calendar: [link]
```

### Reply Bump Guidelines

- Always reference the specific resource or insight you shared
- Never use generic "any thoughts?" or "just bumping this"
- Keep under 30 words
- Example: "Wanted to make sure the [resource name] landed — the section on [specific topic] is what most [their role] find relevant."

### Personalization by Tier

| Tier | Research Time | Personalization Depth |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Tier 1** (Top 50) | 15-20 min/contact | Fully custom: reference their LinkedIn posts, earnings calls, specific initiatives |
| **Tier 2** (200-500) | 5-10 min/contact | Segment + company: reference industry trend + one company-specific detail |
| **Tier 3** (Remaining) | 1-2 min/contact | Role + industry template with company name and basic firmographic variables |

## 2. Executive Events (Dinners, Roundtables, Experiences)

### When to Use
- Targeting Tier 1 accounts where you need executive-level access
- Traditional outbound has not broken through
- You want to accelerate stalled or early-stage opportunities

### Event Types

**Executive Dinners**
- 8-12 attendees: mix of prospects, customers, and internal executives
- No product pitch — frame around an industry topic or shared challenge
- Include 2-3 customer references who can speak peer-to-peer
- Benchmarks: 80% take follow-up meetings, 50% become opportunities, 25-40% close

**Digital Roundtables**
- 6-8 C-suite participants, curated by industry vertical
- Monthly cadence, 60-minute moderated discussion
- Internal executives attend as peers, not presenters
- Serves as a feeder for in-person executive dinners
- No product pitch during the roundtable itself

**Intimate Industry Events**
- Host during major conferences (not your own event, piggyback on existing ones)
- Side dinners, breakfasts, or cocktail hours during industry events
- Leverage the captive audience already in town
- Lower logistics burden, higher attendance rates

### Execution Playbook

1. **Curate the invite list** from Tier 1 accounts — 3x the attendee target (expect 30-40% acceptance)
2. **Frame the topic** around a shared industry challenge, not your product
3. **Secure 2-3 customer speakers** who can share their journey authentically
4. **Personal outreach** for invitations — executive-to-executive, not marketing email
5. **Day-of**: facilitate conversation, ensure every prospect speaks, gather intelligence
6. **Follow-up within 48 hours**: personalized note referencing something specific from the conversation
7. **Transition to pipeline**: propose a 1:1 conversation to explore what was discussed

## 3. Network-Led Pipeline (Referrals & Warm Intros)

### When to Use
- You have relationships (investors, advisors, customers, executives) who connect to target accounts
- Cold outreach to specific accounts has not worked
- Dealing with very senior buyers who do not respond to cold approaches

### The Network Unlock Program

**Step 1: Identify connectors**
Map all potential relationship sources:
- Founders and executive team
- Board members and investors
- Advisors and angel investors
- Happy customers
- Industry analysts and influencers
- Former employees now at target accounts

**Step 2: Score connections**
For each target account, map which connectors have paths in:
- Direct 1st-degree LinkedIn connections to target contacts
- Shared board seats, alma mater, previous companies
- Conference co-speakers or co-authors

**Step 3: Enable connectors**
Do not ask connectors to figure out the ask. Provide:
- Ghost-written intro email (2-3 sentences)
- Full account context (why this account, what the opportunity is)
- The specific ask (intro to a specific person for a specific reason)
- A single point of contact to minimize connector burden

**Step 4: Close the loop**
- Immediately confirm when intros are made
- Report back on meeting outcomes
- Publicly celebrate wins that came from network activation
- This keeps connectors motivated and willing to help again

### Benchmarks
- Network intro → meeting conversion: 40-60%
- Network-sourced pipeline closes 2x faster than cold-sourced
- Network-sourced deals have 30-50% higher win rates

## 4. The Podcast Play

### When to Use
- Need non-threatening way to build executive relationships
- Want to gather account intelligence through conversation
- Building long-term brand and trust in a niche market

### How It Works

1. **Launch a niche industry podcast** (or video series) featuring leaders in your ICP
2. **Invite target account executives** as guests — 70%+ acceptance rate
3. **During the conversation**, naturally learn about their priorities, challenges, and initiatives
4. **Post-recording**, nurture the relationship with a warm follow-up
5. **Transition**: "Based on what you shared about [challenge], I'd love to show you how we're helping companies like yours tackle that"

### Why It Works for High-ACV
- Executives are flattered by speaking invitations
- The conversation provides live discovery without a sales context
- Creates content that positions your company as a thought leader
- Builds genuine relationships that convert over time

---

## 5. Content & Social (Demand Creation)

### When to Use
- Building long-term inbound pipeline in a niche market
- Supporting outbound with brand awareness
- Prospects are researching before engaging with vendors

### Founder/Executive LinkedIn Playbook

**Posting cadence**: 3-5x per week
**Content types that work for high-ACV:**
- Industry insights and contrarian takes
- Lessons from working with customers (anonymized)
- Behind-the-scenes of building the product/company
- Responses to industry news and regulatory changes
- Data and benchmarks relevant to their ICP

**The Social Unstick Tactic:**
When a prospect goes dark on a deal:
1. Publish content directly addressing their specific challenge
2. Have internal contacts tag the prospect or their company
3. Prospect re-engages with the content
4. Use as an opening to reignite the conversation
5. Re-engages approximately 90% of stalled conversations

### Thought Leadership Content

**Goal**: Reframe how prospects think about their problem so your solution becomes the obvious answer.

**Formats by impact:**
1. Original research / benchmarks (highest credibility)
2. Framework posts ("The X Framework for Y")
3. Case studies with quantified outcomes
4. Contrarian takes that challenge conventional wisdom
5. Curated industry analysis

## 6. LinkedIn Ads (ABM Layer)

### When to Use
- Running outbound and want to surround target accounts with awareness
- Retargeting website visitors from target accounts
- Warming accounts before outbound sequences begin

### ABM Ad Strategy

**Pre-outbound (2-4 weeks before sequences start):**
- Run thought leadership ads to target account list
- Goal: brand recognition, not clicks
- Budget: $20-50/day is sufficient for a small TAM

**During outbound:**
- Retarget accounts that have engaged with emails or visited site
- Serve case studies, testimonials, and outcome-focused content
- Matched audience targeting by company name or email list

**Post-meeting:**
- Serve deal-stage-specific content to accounts in pipeline
- Customer stories from their industry vertical
- ROI calculators, implementation guides

### Budget Guidance
LinkedIn CPMs are expensive ($30-80+). For high-ACV with small TAM:
- $2,000-5,000/month is sufficient for ABM surround
- Focus on impressions and frequency, not click volume
- Measure pipeline influence, not direct conversion

## 7. Partner & Channel Plays

### When to Use
- Target accounts are already customers of a complementary product
- You can create mutual value through integration or co-selling
- Need access to accounts that are difficult to reach directly

### Execution

1. **Identify complementary vendors** whose customers match your ICP
2. **Build the integration** or partnership value prop
3. **Co-create content**: joint webinars, case studies, integration guides
4. **Enable partner sales teams**: provide them with positioning and talk tracks
5. **Co-sell into mutual target accounts**: leverage their existing relationships

### Key Principle
Partners are most motivated when the partnership clearly helps them serve their customers better, not just when it helps you sell.

## Channel Prioritization Matrix

When starting from scratch, prioritize channels based on current assets:

| If You Have... | Start With | Then Add |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| Strong founder network | Network-led + exec events | Outbound sequences |
| Good product + customers | Case studies + outbound | LinkedIn ABM + content |
| Small team, no network | Outbound sequences + content | Network building + events |
| Existing inbound engine | Qualification + ABM layer | Outbound to non-inbound accounts |
| Partner ecosystem | Co-selling + channel | Outbound to non-partner accounts |
