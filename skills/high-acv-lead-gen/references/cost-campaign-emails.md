## Email 1: Cost Insight

**Goal:** Deliver value, earn the open, no product pitch.

**Subject:** patent cost at {{ company }}

{{ contact.firstname }}, patent cost rarely spikes overnight — it escapes gradually through outside counsel rework, extended prosecution, and internal admin friction.

We talked to a dozen Heads of IP about where the pressure actually builds. Wrote up what we heard:

Curious if this matches what you're seeing at {{ company }}.

## Email 2: Peer Benchmark Survey

**Goal:** Introduce survey as a value exchange. Reference email 1 (sequence weaving).

**Subject:** how {{ company }} compares on patent costs

{{ contact.firstname }}, I shared an article last week on where patent cost pressure builds — a few IP leaders told us the outside counsel section hit close to home.

It got us thinking: most Heads of IP feel the pressure but have no way to compare their approach to peers.

We're running a 3-minute survey to fix that. Participants get the aggregated results first.

## Email 3: Case Study

**Goal:** Provide proof through a specific, concrete example. Reference prior emails.

**Subject:** how a robotics company cut patent renewal costs

{{ contact.firstname }}, wanted to share a quick example relevant to what we've been discussing.

A robotics AI company was spending heavily on renewals for patents that no longer aligned with their product roadmap. They implemented a risk-scoring approach to pruning decisions and freed up significant renewal budget — without increasing exposure.

We wrote up how they did it alongside two other examples (healthcare and enterprise software):

## Email 4: Breakup

**Goal:** Create gentle urgency. Use survey data as social proof. First and only meeting ask.

**Subject:** closing the loop

{{ contact.firstname }}, I've shared a few things over the past couple of weeks — don't want to overstay my welcome.

One thing worth passing along: 76% of IP leaders in our survey said office actions are the primary area where they see inefficiency in the patent lifecycle.

If cost pressure is on your radar this year, I'd welcome a 15-minute conversation about what we're seeing across IP teams like yours.

If the timing isn't right, no worries — I'll close the loop here.

## Design Principles Applied

| Principle | How It Shows Up |
|-----------|----------------|
| **One email, one job** | Each email has exactly one CTA |
| **Value before ask** | Emails 1-3 give value; email 4 is the only meeting ask |
| **Sequence weaving** | Each email references the prior one |
| **Peer-level tone** | Written as a person, not a brand |
| **Under 100 words** | 60-85 words per email body |
| **No fake RE:** | Real subject lines with company personalization |
| **Breakup framing** | Email 4 creates urgency without pressure |
| **Multi-channel weave** | LinkedIn touches between emails reinforce the narrative |

## Personalization Guide

| Tier | Subject Line | Opening Line | Example |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** (top 50) | Company name + specific reference | Reference their LinkedIn post, earnings call, or recent initiative | "Saw {{ company }} filed 40+ patents last quarter — that volume usually brings cost pressure in prosecution" |
| **Tier 2** (200-500) | Company name | Industry-specific observation | "Patent teams in med-device are feeling cost pressure from both prosecution volume and renewal sprawl" |
| **Tier 3** (remaining) | Company name | Role-based observation | Use templates above as written |
