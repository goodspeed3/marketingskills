# 20 Indirect LinkedIn Content Ideas for Jonathan Liu / ArcPrime
**Generated**: 2026-02-17
**Focus**: 100% Indirect — career, leadership, peer dynamics, AI & future, influence, craft
**Goal**: Build trust, relatability, and thought-leader positioning with Heads of IP / Patent leaders

---

## CAREER (Ideas 1–4)

---

### Idea 1: "The best Heads of IP are not the best patent attorneys."

**Format**: Uncomfortable Truth
**Category**: Career / Leadership transition

**Hook**:
> Technical excellence gets you to senior counsel. It will not get you to Head of IP. The promotion catches people off guard because the new job requires skills they were never trained for.

**Timely Angle**: The Head of IP role is evolving from "senior patent attorney" to "strategic executive." GCs and CFOs expect IP leaders to tie portfolios to revenue and M&A strategy. But law schools and firms train you for the craft, not for budget negotiation, executive communication, or cross-functional influence.

**ICP Connection**: Identity-level. Every Head of IP either made this transition recently, is in the middle of it, or is watching someone struggle with it. The emotional hook is recognition: "that's exactly what happened to me."

**Key Points**:
1. The moment the job changes: from "write the best patent" to "decide where to spend $5M"
2. Three skills that matter more than legal expertise at the leadership level: budget negotiation, cross-functional influence, executive communication
3. Some of the best patent attorneys make mediocre IP leaders; some mediocre attorneys make exceptional leaders. The skill sets are that different.
4. What actually helps: find a mentor who's done it, read business strategy (not just IP journals), and accept that the learning curve is supposed to be steep

**Soft CTA**: "What was the hardest part of your transition from practitioner to leader? I'm still figuring parts of it out."

**Product Tie-In**: None — pure trust-building.

### Idea 2: "The imposter syndrome problem in patent law is uniquely bad."

**Format**: Founder Vulnerability
**Category**: Career / Peer challenges

**Hook**:
> I spent years at Meta wondering if I was actually good at my job. Not because anyone told me I wasn't — but because in patent law, you literally can't know for 5-10 years.

**Timely Angle**: Jonathan's Post #9 about slow feedback loops (4.7K impressions, 21 comments) clearly struck a nerve. Combine with the burnout data (97% of in-house counsel stressed) and AI adding a new layer of career uncertainty — "Am I good at this, or is the AI good at this?"

**ICP Connection**: Patent counsel are high-achievers (bar passage, technical degrees, top firms) who operate in chronic ambiguity about whether their work was actually good. There's no quarterly scorecard. No revenue attribution. No review that says "that claim you wrote in 2019 just won a $50M lawsuit."

**Key Points**:
1. The structural cause: feedback loops are 5-10 years long. You file today and won't know if it mattered until litigation or licensing years later.
2. Perfectionism makes it worse: patent law selects for the exact personality type most susceptible to imposter syndrome
3. AI adds a new flavor: "Am I good at this, or is the AI good at this?"
4. The partial antidote: find peers who'll be honest, build shorter feedback mechanisms, accept that ambiguity is the nature of the work

**Soft CTA**: "If you've ever wondered whether you're actually good at this — or just lucky — you're not alone. What helps you stay grounded?"

**Product Tie-In**: None.

---

### Idea 3: "What I wish someone told me before going in-house."

**Format**: Insider War Story
**Category**: Career / Transition

**Hook**:
> Going in-house felt like escaping. No more billable hours. No more partner reviews. Six months later I realized I'd traded one kind of pressure for another — and no one warned me.

**Timely Angle**: World IP Review's 2026 in-house counsel series highlights evolving metrics and expectations. 56% of in-house counsel looking to move would go BACK to law firms (Axiom 2026 study) — in-house is no longer the escape hatch it once was.

**ICP Connection**: Many Heads of IP made this transition. The "grass is greener" moment resonates universally. People who went in-house and struggled will feel seen; people still at firms considering the move will bookmark this.

**Key Points**:
1. Billing pressure disappears — but gets replaced by budget pressure. At a firm, someone else manages the P&L. In-house, you ARE the P&L for your function.
2. You go from deep specialist to broad strategist overnight. Suddenly you need to care about vendor management, headcount planning, and internal politics.
3. The skill that matters most isn't legal — it's influence. You're surrounded by non-lawyers who control your budget and priorities.
4. The thing nobody tells you: you'll miss the craft. In-house, you spend less time doing the work and more time managing the people who do it.

**Soft CTA**: "For those who made the move in-house: what surprised you most? And for those considering it: what questions do you wish you'd asked?"

**Product Tie-In**: None.

---

### Idea 4: "Hiring patent counsel in 2026: the market is splitting in two."

**Format**: Peer Benchmark / 'How Others Do It'
**Category**: Career / AI & Future

**Hook**:
> 86% of large law firms plan to grow their associate ranks through 2027 — but only 35% plan to grow their first-year classes. That gap tells you everything about where this profession is heading.

**Timely Angle**: Carterwill's AmLaw AI Shift report and NALP data showing record entry-level hiring in 2024 alongside firms leaning toward more senior demographics. The market is bifurcating: AI-literate counsel who can bridge technical understanding with strategy command premiums. Traditional prosecution-only roles are flat.

**ICP Connection**: Every Head of IP is either hiring, trying to retain, or watching talent leave. The question "what skills should I hire for?" is one they're actively grappling with.

**Key Points**:
1. The data: firms are shifting to fewer juniors and more senior lawyers — driven by AI handling foundational work
2. In-house, the shift is even more dramatic: IP teams want "hybrid" counsel who can handle prosecution AND portfolio strategy AND AI tool evaluation
3. The attorneys commanding premium comp are the ones who bridge technical AI understanding with legal strategy
4. If you're hiring: stop looking for the best drafter. Start looking for the best strategic thinker who can also use AI to draft.

**Soft CTA**: "What's the #1 skill you're hiring for on your IP team right now? Curious whether it's changed in the last 2 years."

**Product Tie-In**: None — but positions ArcPrime as the kind of tool the "new breed" of counsel would use.

## LEADERSHIP (Ideas 5–8)

---

### Idea 5: "97% of in-house counsel report burnout. We keep pretending everything's fine."

**Format**: Uncomfortable Truth
**Category**: Leadership / Peer challenges

**Hook**:
> 97% of in-house counsel report stress and burnout. 39% call it severe. Yet in every meeting I attend, everyone says they're "doing great." The gap between what IP leaders say publicly and feel privately is enormous.

**Timely Angle**: Axiom's 2026 Global In-House Talent Study — 46% of satisfied, well-compensated lawyers are actively job searching. Burnout is driven by operational pressure (10x more likely to job search), rising workloads (78%), and growing complexity (77%).

**ICP Connection**: This IS the ICP. The recognition alone — "someone in my field said this out loud" — creates enormous trust. This is the post people screenshot and send to their spouse.

**Key Points**:
1. 97% report burnout AND 83% report satisfaction. Both true. "I love this work" makes it harder to admit "this work is destroying me."
2. Patent-specific drivers: perfectionism, 5-10 year feedback loops, invisible impact
3. 56% of those looking to move would go BACK to law firms — in-house is no longer the refuge
4. What's working: workload rebalancing (16% burnout reduction per Gartner), automating admin, and leaders admitting it's hard

**Soft CTA**: "If you manage a team: when was the last time you asked your people how they're actually doing — and meant it?"

**Product Tie-In**: None. Pure trust-building.

---

### Idea 6: "The 'do more with less' mandate is breaking IP teams. Here's what the survivors are doing differently."

**Format**: Peer Benchmark / 'How Others Do It'
**Category**: Leadership / Budget pressure

**Hook**:
> Flat budgets. Growing portfolios. Rising renewal fees. "Do more with less" used to mean find efficiencies. Now it means choose what NOT to protect. Most IP leaders aren't ready for that conversation.

**Timely Angle**: Juristat's Fall 2025 IP Counsel Cafe found cost restrictions are impacting nearly every facet of portfolio strategy, forcing teams to be more surgical about where and what they file. Patent analytics teams are under pressure to produce CFO-ready reporting.

**ICP Connection**: Every Head of IP is living this. The mandate comes from the GC, who heard it from the CFO. But nobody tells you HOW to do more with less — just that you must.

**Key Points**:
1. The squeeze: renewal fees rising, filing costs up, team size flat, portfolio growing. The math doesn't work.
2. What the surviving teams have in common: they stopped treating every filing as equal. They tier their portfolio into "strategic," "defensive," and "legacy" — and treat each differently.
3. The uncomfortable shift: from "we protect everything" to "we protect what matters." This requires saying no — to inventors, to business units, to tradition.
4. The teams that thrive have IP leaders who reframe the conversation: "We're not cutting. We're focusing."

**Soft CTA**: "How has your team adapted to budget pressure? Curious whether others are tiering their portfolios or taking a different approach."

**Product Tie-In**: Light — ArcPrime enables the tiering/data-driven approach described. One sentence max.

---

### Idea 7: "The real reason your IP team resists new tools. It's not the tech."

**Format**: Contrarian Take
**Category**: Leadership / Change management

**Hook**:
> I've watched IP teams reject tools that would save them hundreds of hours a year. The problem was never the software. It was what the software represented.

**Timely Angle**: IP Counsel Cafe Fall 2025 found that "AI is no longer a shiny new object, and teams that don't begin adopting will eventually fall behind." Yet adoption remains slow. The 2026 Axiom study shows 97% of teams have wrong talent mix — suggesting the issue is culture and skills, not just tooling.

**ICP Connection**: Every Head of IP who's tried to roll out a new tool has hit this wall. The frustration is real. This post names the real blockers — identity and control — not just "training" or "UX."

**Key Points**:
1. Tool adoption failure in IP is almost never about features or UI. It's about three things: workflow disruption fear, loss of control over quality, and the unspoken belief "my way works fine."
2. Patent counsel identity is deeply tied to their craft. Suggesting a tool can do part of their job feels like suggesting they're not good enough.
3. Change management in IP requires addressing identity, not features. Ask: "What does this tool let you do MORE of?" not "What does this tool replace?"
4. The teams that adopt successfully start with the frustrated, not the resistant. Find the person drowning in admin work and make them the champion.

**Soft CTA**: "What's the biggest resistance you've encountered when rolling out new tools to your IP team? And what broke through?"

**Product Tie-In**: Highly relevant (ArcPrime literally solves this) but the post should NOT mention ArcPrime. Let it be about the problem. Trust is the goal.

---

### Idea 8: "Managing a team is lonely. Managing a patent team is lonelier."

**Format**: Founder Vulnerability
**Category**: Leadership / Isolation

**Hook**:
> When I was patent counsel, I had peers. We'd complain about the same examiner, debate claim language, compare office action strategies. When I started leading a team, those conversations stopped.

**Timely Angle**: The burnout research shows that patent-specific isolation compounds the general in-house loneliness. Patent law is so specialized that few people in your own company understand what you do — and the people who DO understand (other Heads of IP) work at competitors.

**ICP Connection**: The loneliness of IP leadership is almost never discussed publicly. Heads of IP can't vent to their team (they're the boss), can't vent to their GC (who doesn't understand patents), and can't vent to peers at other companies (competitive dynamics). This post names something real.

**Key Points**:
1. The transition from peer to leader eliminates your primary support system overnight
2. IP leaders are doubly isolated: they're managers (lonely) in a hyper-specialized field (lonelier)
3. The irony: the people who best understand your challenges are at competing companies
4. What helps: peer groups (AIPLA, IPO), honest relationships with 2-3 IP leaders you trust, and being willing to say "I don't know" out loud

**Soft CTA**: "Who do you talk to when you're stuck on an IP leadership problem? Not a patent problem — a leadership problem."

**Product Tie-In**: None.

## INFLUENCE (Ideas 9–12)

---

### Idea 9: "How to explain your patent portfolio to a CFO in 5 minutes."

**Format**: Simple Framework
**Category**: Influence / Executive communication

**Hook**:
> Your CFO doesn't care about claim construction, prosecution history, or office action response rates. They care about three things: What are we protected from? What are we exposed to? What does it cost?

**Timely Angle**: IPWatchdog's Feb 2026 piece on patent portfolio economics: legal explanations alone are "entirely unlikely to be persuasive when offered to top business executives." With fee increases and budget pressure, IP leaders must justify spend more rigorously than ever.

**ICP Connection**: "Justifying IP budget to a CFO who sees patents as a cost center" — #1 influence pain point. This is the skill that determines whether you get budget or get cut.

**Key Points**:
1. The mistake: translating patent strategy into legal language. CFOs speak risk, return, and cost.
2. The framework: (a) Here's what we protect — mapped to revenue. (b) Here's our exposure — mapped to threats. (c) Here's the cost — and where we can save.
3. The visual: one slide. Portfolio coverage vs. competitive exposure. No prosecution timelines. One picture.
4. The phrase: "Our patents are insurance against X. Here's the premium and here's the coverage."

**Soft CTA**: "What's your go-to framework for presenting IP to non-lawyers?"

**Product Tie-In**: Light — ArcPrime's portfolio visualization produces CFO-ready output. But the post stands alone.

### Idea 10: "The hardest conversation in IP isn't about patents. It's about people."

**Format**: Insider War Story
**Category**: Influence / Cross-functional dynamics

**Hook**:
> The hardest thing I had to do as patent counsel at Meta wasn't writing patents. It was telling an inventor their idea wasn't worth patenting.

**Timely Angle**: With "do more with less" tightening, the pressure to say "no" more often is increasing. But the skill of saying no WELL is never taught in law school or at firms.

**ICP Connection**: Every IP leader knows this dynamic. Inventors have emotional attachment. Saying "no" risks the IP-R&D relationship — and a damaged relationship means fewer disclosures next year.

**Key Points**:
1. The specific moment: an inventor who spent 6 months on something that wasn't patentable
2. Why most counsel avoid the conversation and just file everything — path of least resistance creates bloat
3. The reframe: "no" → "not this, but what about X?" Redirect toward higher-value ideas.
4. The compound cost: 20 marginal cases/year × $30K lifecycle × 10 years = $6M in low-ROI assets

**Soft CTA**: "How do you handle it when an inventor's idea isn't worth filing? Still working on getting better at this."

**Product Tie-In**: Light — detectability scoring gives objective data for the conversation.

---

### Idea 11: "Building a patent portfolio is more political than people think."

**Format**: Uncomfortable Truth
**Category**: Influence / Internal politics

**Hook**:
> "Patent what's valuable" sounds obvious. Try saying that to a VP whose product line you just decided not to protect.

**Timely Angle**: Jonathan's Post #18 (1.8K impressions) touched this nerve. As budgets tighten and IP teams are forced to prioritize, the political dimension of patent strategy is becoming impossible to ignore. Juristat found IP teams are under pressure to produce data-driven justifications — partly to depoliticize these decisions.

**ICP Connection**: Every Head of IP navigates internal politics around patent committees, filing decisions, and budget allocation. The "right" patent strategy and the "politically safe" patent strategy are often different — and nobody talks about how to handle that.

**Key Points**:
1. Patent committees have stakeholders with competing agendas: R&D wants breadth, legal wants quality, finance wants fewer filings
2. Business unit leaders take it personally when "their" patents get cut. It feels like a vote against their product.
3. The best IP leaders build political capital BEFORE they need to make unpopular decisions — by sharing data, involving stakeholders early, and framing pruning as reinvestment
4. Data depoliticizes: "We're not cutting your patents. The data shows these other areas have higher enforcement value."

**Soft CTA**: "What's the most politically difficult patent decision you've had to navigate? How did you handle it?"

**Product Tie-In**: ArcPrime's data depoliticizes decisions. But let the reader make that connection.

---

### Idea 12: "Your IP team is invisible until something goes wrong."

**Format**: The Analogy Post
**Category**: Influence / Visibility

**Hook**:
> Patent teams are the goalkeepers of the company. Nobody notices you until you let one in. And then it's all anyone talks about.

**Timely Angle**: The shift from IP-as-cost-center to IP-as-strategic-function. Executives now expect IP teams to explain which patents protect revenue — but most companies still don't celebrate IP wins the way they celebrate sales wins or product launches. The visibility gap is widening.

**ICP Connection**: "Making IP visible and valued inside the company" — a universal frustration. IP leaders do essential, high-stakes work that is structurally invisible.

**Key Points**:
1. The goalkeeper analogy: you make 99 great saves and nobody applauds. One slip and everyone asks what happened.
2. Why IP is structurally invisible: impact takes years to materialize, wins are "things that DIDN'T happen" (lawsuits avoided, competitors deterred), and the language is impenetrable to non-lawyers
3. The IP leaders who gain visibility share proactive stories: "We identified a competitor risk 18 months ago. Here's what we did about it." They turn invisible defense into visible offense.
4. Practical tactic: send a quarterly one-pager to your GC and CFO — not patent metrics, but business outcomes tied to IP

**Soft CTA**: "How do you make your IP team's work visible to the rest of the company? The struggle is real."

**Product Tie-In**: None.

## AI & FUTURE (Ideas 13–16)

---

### Idea 13: "A law firm replaced an associate with AI. Costs dropped 27%. Here's what they're not telling you."

**Format**: Contrarian Take
**Category**: AI & Future / Training crisis

**Hook**:
> A small firm just admitted they didn't backfill a departing associate — they gave AI the work instead. Costs are down 27%. Every junior patent associate should read this. But not for the reason you think.

**Timely Angle**: Above the Law reported (Feb 2026) on a firm leaning on AI instead of hiring. Meanwhile, 86% of large firms plan to grow associate ranks, but only 35% plan to grow first-year classes (Carterwill). Firms are layering AI onto processes, not restructuring them — yet.

**ICP Connection**: Every Head of IP manages OC relationships and is watching this trend. Two questions: "If my firm is using AI, why am I paying the same rate?" And: "If AI handles the grunt work, how do junior attorneys learn?"

**Key Points**:
1. What the firm actually said: AI can't argue motions or spot deposition issues. But it can do the foundational work.
2. The paradox: hiring is UP and automation is UP — because firms haven't restructured yet
3. The real risk: the training gap. Associates learned through grunt work. That's being automated. So how do they develop judgment?
4. Jonathan's Fish & Richardson perspective: the associate plants the flag. If they never learn to plant it themselves, who drafts the next generation of strong patents?

**Soft CTA**: "If you manage OC: are you asking whether AI is doing the work you're paying associate rates for?"

**Product Tie-In**: None.

---

### Idea 14: "AI won't replace patent attorneys. But it will expose the ones who were just going through the motions."

**Format**: Contrarian Take
**Category**: AI & Future / Professional identity

**Hook**:
> The patent attorneys most afraid of AI aren't the worst ones. They're the ones who know they've been on autopilot.

**Timely Angle**: Harter Secrest & Emery's 2026 analysis on AI patent drafting risks: "legal quality and strategy must remain in expert hands." AIPLA panels on the "skills gap" highlight that AI amplifies the difference between thoughtful counsel and rote practitioners. The profession is being sorted.

**ICP Connection**: Every IP leader has counsel (in-house or outside) who range from exceptional to average. AI makes the gap visible because it handles the baseline — leaving only the strategic and creative work that separates good from great.

**Key Points**:
1. AI handles the blank-page problem. That means the excuse "I spent 20 hours getting started" evaporates.
2. What remains after AI does the first draft: judgment, strategy, claim framing, understanding what the examiner will challenge, knowing what competitors will try to design around
3. The attorneys who thrive will be the ones who were already doing the thinking — AI just removes the busywork that hid the gap between thinkers and processors
4. This is actually liberating for good attorneys: AI lets you skip the boring parts and focus on the work you're uniquely good at

**Soft CTA**: "What's the one part of your patent work that you'd NEVER trust AI to do? That's probably where your real value lives."

**Product Tie-In**: None — but implicitly positions ArcPrime as a tool for thinkers, not processors.

---

### Idea 15: "How to evaluate AI tools when every vendor says 'AI-powered.'"

**Format**: Simple Framework
**Category**: AI & Future / Tool evaluation

**Hook**:
> Every patent management vendor now claims to be "AI-powered." Most of them added a ChatGPT wrapper to their legacy software and called it innovation. Here's how to tell the difference.

**Timely Angle**: IP Counsel Cafe Fall 2025: "AI is no longer a shiny new object, and teams that don't begin adopting will eventually fall behind." But adoption requires evaluation, and most IP leaders aren't trained to assess AI tools — they're trained to assess legal arguments.

**ICP Connection**: "How to evaluate AI tools when every vendor claims to use AI" — a direct frustration. Every Head of IP has sat through vendor demos that all sound the same.

**Key Points**:
1. The wrapper test: Can the vendor explain what their AI actually does differently from prompting an LLM? If not, you're buying a $100K ChatGPT wrapper.
2. The data test: Where did they get their training data? Patent-specific models trained on prosecution history, litigation outcomes, and claims language perform differently than general-purpose models.
3. The workflow test: Does it fit into how your team actually works, or does it require rebuilding your process around the tool?
4. The output test: Can you verify the AI's work? If the tool gives you a confidence score but won't show its reasoning, be skeptical.

**Soft CTA**: "What's your process for evaluating AI tools? I've seen teams waste 6 months on pilots that were doomed from the start."

**Product Tie-In**: Moderate — this is the kind of post where transparency about ArcPrime's approach is authentic. "Here's how we'd answer these questions about our own product." But only if it feels earned.

---

### Idea 16: "The ethics question nobody in IP is asking about AI."

**Format**: Craft / Career Reflection
**Category**: AI & Future / Ethics

**Hook**:
> Everyone's debating whether AI can be named as an inventor. Almost nobody is asking the harder question: what are your obligations when AI helps draft a patent that you sign?

**Timely Angle**: USPTO has clarified that AI cannot be named as inventor and generative AI systems are "merely tools." But the duty of candor, duty of disclosure, and Rule 11 obligations still rest with the attorney. As AI-assisted drafting becomes standard, the gap between "AI wrote the first draft" and "I stand behind every word" is getting harder to bridge.

**ICP Connection**: Appeals to the craft-minded attorneys in the ICP. The ones who care about quality and ethics are thinking about this — but few people are talking about it publicly. Being the person who names it builds enormous credibility.

**Key Points**:
1. The inventor question is settled (for now): AI can't be named. But the attorney-responsibility question is open.
2. When AI generates a claim limitation or a prior art argument, and you include it in a filing, you're representing it as your work product. Do you have the obligation to verify every assertion the AI made?
3. The analogy: paralegals research, associates draft, partners review. Everyone understands the chain of responsibility. Where does AI fit in that chain?
4. The practical concern: as AI handles more of the drafting, attorneys may review less carefully — not from laziness, but from calibrated trust. That calibration is dangerous when AI confidently generates plausible but incorrect claim constructions.

**Soft CTA**: "Where do you draw the line between 'AI-assisted' and 'AI-authored' in your practice? I think about this more than I'd like to admit."

**Product Tie-In**: None.

## PEER CHALLENGES (Ideas 17–18)

---

### Idea 17: "The unspoken tension between in-house counsel and outside counsel."

**Format**: Uncomfortable Truth
**Category**: Peer challenges / Industry dynamics

**Hook**:
> In-house counsel manage budgets. Outside counsel bill hours. The incentives are fundamentally misaligned — and both sides know it but rarely say it out loud.

**Timely Angle**: BlueIron IP's analysis calls it bluntly: "The patent attorney sells hours but the client wants to buy a business asset." AI is about to blow this dynamic wide open — if AI can draft in 2 hours what an associate drafts in 20, the hourly model collapses.

**ICP Connection**: Every Head of IP manages OC relationships and has experienced this tension. Many feel uncomfortable naming it because they depend on their outside counsel. This post gives them permission to think about it.

**Key Points**:
1. The structural problem: OC makes more money during prosecution (office actions) than preparation (initial filing). The incentive is to keep cases pending.
2. Most in-house counsel know this but don't address it — because switching firms is expensive, relationships are personal, and "the devil you know" feels safer
3. AI changes the equation: if AI can do the first draft, the value of OC shifts from execution to judgment and strategy. That makes the hourly model indefensible for routine work.
4. The solution isn't adversarial: it's aligned incentives. Fixed-fee arrangements, success-based bonuses, and transparent AI-usage policies. The best OC relationships in 2026 will look very different from 2020.

**Soft CTA**: "How has your relationship with outside counsel changed in the last 2 years? Are you having the AI conversation with them?"

**Product Tie-In**: Light — ArcPrime's network of AI-enabled counsel at lower cost is directly relevant, but the post is about the dynamic, not the product.

---

### Idea 18: "Why most patent committees are theater."

**Format**: Contrarian Take
**Category**: Peer challenges / Process criticism

**Hook**:
> Your patent committee probably meets monthly, reviews 20 cases in 90 minutes, and rubber-stamps decisions that were already made. If that sounds familiar, you're not alone.

**Timely Angle**: As IP teams face "do more with less" mandates, the overhead of maintaining committee structures that don't actually improve outcomes is harder to justify. Teams replacing committees with data-driven scoring report faster decisions and better portfolio alignment.

**ICP Connection**: Patent committee frustration is UNIVERSAL among IP leaders. This is the ultimate "someone finally said it" post. The comments will be fire.

**Key Points**:
1. The theory: committees provide diverse perspectives and rigorous decision-making. The reality: they compress complex decisions into 4-minute reviews and default to "file."
2. Why they persist: liability diffusion ("the committee decided"), tradition ("we've always done it this way"), and politics ("we need VP buy-in")
3. The alternative: clear decision criteria + data scoring + individual authority with accountability. One person with good data makes better decisions than 8 people with none.
4. If you must have a committee: narrow the scope. Committees should decide strategy (which technology areas to invest in), not individual case outcomes.

**Soft CTA**: "Does your patent committee actually change outcomes, or does it ratify decisions already made? Honest answers only."

**Product Tie-In**: ArcPrime's scoring and valuation tools enable the data-driven alternative. But don't mention it — the post is about the problem.

## CRAFT (Ideas 19–20)

---

### Idea 19: "What separates a good patent from a great one."

**Format**: Craft / Career Reflection
**Category**: Craft / Professional pride

**Hook**:
> The first time I saw true craftsmanship in patent law was at Fish & Richardson. Hans Troesch's work was like seeing a new primary color. It redefined what "excellence" meant for me.

**Timely Angle**: AI-generated first drafts are raising the floor of patent quality — but also compressing the perceived difference between good and great. The attorneys who understand what AI CAN'T do (strategic claim framing, anticipating competitor design-arounds, understanding the examiner's psychology) are the ones producing the work that actually holds up in litigation.

**ICP Connection**: Appeals directly to professional pride. Patent attorneys chose this career because they love the craft. Amidst all the talk about AI and cost-cutting, a post that celebrates the art of patent writing will feel refreshing and affirming.

**Key Points**:
1. The Hans Troesch moment: seeing patent work that was so precise and strategic it changed Jonathan's standard of excellence
2. What makes a patent "great" vs. merely "good": (a) claims that read on actual products, not just the disclosure, (b) specification that anticipates continuation opportunities, (c) prosecution strategy that builds a record for enforcement
3. AI raises the floor: the worst patents will get better. But the best patents still require human judgment about what the market will look like in 5 years.
4. The craftsperson's advantage in 2026: AI handles volume, but strategic claim framing is art, not automation

**Soft CTA**: "Who taught you what 'great' looks like in patent work? I think most of us can point to one person who reset our bar."

**Product Tie-In**: None.

---

### Idea 20: "How to give feedback on a patent draft without crushing the person who wrote it."

**Format**: Simple Framework
**Category**: Craft / Leadership / Mentorship

**Hook**:
> A partner once looked at something I wrote and said, "Do you know how to write a paragraph?" I learned from that moment. But not in the way he intended.

**Timely Angle**: Referencing Jonathan's Post #7 (5K impressions, 7 comments) on writing and clear thinking. As AI changes how drafts are produced, the feedback conversation is evolving too — are you giving feedback on the attorney's work, or on the AI's output that the attorney reviewed? The skill of giving good feedback matters more than ever.

**ICP Connection**: Every IP leader gives feedback on patent drafts — to associates, to outside counsel, to team members. Most were never taught how to do it well. The ones who mentor well build loyalty and develop talent; the ones who don't create turnover and resentment.

**Key Points**:
1. The bad way: "This is wrong." (Demoralizing, unspecific, teaches nothing.)
2. The better way: "Here's what I see. Here's why it matters. Here's what I'd do differently." Explain the reasoning, not just the correction.
3. The best way: ask questions first. "What was your thinking on this claim limitation?" Sometimes the associate had a reason you didn't consider.
4. In the AI era: the feedback conversation shifts from "you should have written this differently" to "you should have caught that the AI missed this." That's a very different skill — and a much harder conversation.

**Soft CTA**: "What's the best feedback you've ever received on your patent work? And how did it change how you give feedback to others?"

**Product Tie-In**: None.

## Content Calendar: 10-Week Rollout

Post 2x/week, cycling through categories so the feed never feels repetitive:

| Week | Tue | Thu |
|------|-----|-----|
| 1 | #5 Burnout truth | #1 Best Heads of IP |
| 2 | #13 AI replacing associates | #10 Telling inventors no |
| 3 | #9 CFO in 5 minutes | #17 In-house vs OC tension |
| 4 | #2 Imposter syndrome | #18 Patent committee theater |
| 5 | #6 Do more with less | #14 AI exposes autopilot |
| 6 | #19 Good vs. great patent | #7 Why teams resist tools |
| 7 | #3 Going in-house | #12 IP is invisible |
| 8 | #15 Evaluating AI tools | #8 Leadership is lonely |
| 9 | #11 Portfolio politics | #4 Hiring market split |
| 10 | #16 AI ethics question | #20 Giving draft feedback |

**Pattern**: Alternate categories each week. Lead Tuesdays with higher-engagement formats (Uncomfortable Truth, Founder Vulnerability). Thursdays for frameworks and reflections. The burnout post (#5) and imposter syndrome post (#2) should anchor weeks 1 and 4 — they'll generate the most comments and shares.
