## Post #1 - Asserted Patents Analysis

**Posted:** 1 month ago (Edited)  
**Impressions:** 16,618

**Reactions:** 119 (Micheal Binns, Esq. and 118 others)

**Full Content:**

I analyzed 9,700 asserted patents from 6,500 litigations over the last five years and compared them to a control set of 10,000 randomly selected granted patents from the same period. Here's the insights I found most interesting:

**1) You can't prosecute your way into being asserted**
Office Action histories are nearly identical: 94% of both asserted and control patents received 4 or more Office Actions (median = 1).

**2) Asserted patents were disproportionately continuations**
50% of asserted patents were continuations, vs. 20% of the broader population.

**3) Assertion was more often bought than built**
Control patents sit closer to a 38% acquired to 62% organic split, but litigated patents skew toward acquisition.

Across litigated patents, ~55% were acquired, and the data shows this skew persists at ~42% even for operating companies (filtering out NPEs).

From just these stats, the data clearly says: **run a pruning program if you want a high ROI patent portfolio**. In the past 5 years, assertion value was concentrated in a small subset of patents that are clearly prosecuted and continuation-rich — so most portfolios may be overfunding low-ROI assets and should prune to redirect resources to the few patents that can actually generate returns.

We're working on a full report combining USPTO data with AI analysis grounded in web research. The report will include detailed breakdowns across the three categories below. I'll share more insights over the coming weeks. And if there are additional angles you'd like us to analyze, tell us & we'll crunch the data if it's accessible.

1. Patent Properties

- Patent type (utility / design / reissue)
- Continuation vs not
- Family size
- Acquired vs organic
- Spec metrics: # of independent claims, # of drawings, word count, paragraph count, first-claim word count (broken down by industry)
- Years since priority (age)
- Number of inventors

2. Patent "Quality" Signals

- Track One vs not
- Number of office actions to allowance
- Number of forward citations

3. Litigation & Parties

- Venue
- Reason for litigation
- NPE vs operating company
- Industry of parties
- Operating-company industry relationship
- Market caps (operating companies)
- Num unique assertors vs. num unique defendants

## Post #2 - Facebook Patent Team Problem

**Posted:** 10 months ago

**Full Content:**

I never got to solve this one problem on the Facebook patent team. It still nags at me.

I wanted the best patents. But choosing whether to keep investing in a case felt like shooting in the dark. Our IP Management System (IPMS, aka 'patent database') had the case information but no actionable data. Part of my role at Facebook was to integrate data into the team's workflow as much as possible, but I can't say I succeeded.

That's why we're building ArcPrime, a fancy patent database with a floodlight and robot arms.

As patent counsel, you're supposed to make strategic decisions on how to get the best patents. Since only a small percentage of patents are litigated or licensed, your job is not unlike what VCs do: take an educated (or not) guess at which industries will matter in 5-10 years and play the power law game.

If your job is to figure out whether to invest in a patent, what are the first questions you'd ask yourself? Probably something basic like how much will this cost me to get, and what will I get in return?

Here's what I mostly used to answer that question: the words in the patent, whatever I read on Twitter, and my gut. Litigation, PTO, competitor, and licensing data were out there but not systematically used. Outsiders looking in may think this is pretty shocking, which it is. But to be fair, it's non-trivial to make sense of all that data in a pre-AI world.

And let's assume there was no data out there other than the words in a patent. There are a LOT of words in a patent. You still have to decide how much time you spend on each one. Maybe you can afford to spend 1-2 hours on a sampling of cases given your portfolio size.

Yet, sometimes spending just a few minutes elaborating a specific claim element based on your contextual knowledge will be the difference between validity and invalidity or infringement and non-infringement. The question is: did you pick the right case to spend those few minutes on?

As one can expect, AI is the gamechanger.

Inhouse attorneys are already world-class at triaging risk by business impact. There's an endless list of things to get to, but never enough time.

AI has the time. It can finish that endless list. We thank AI for helping us finally solve my nagging problem.

## Post #3 - ArcPrime Funding Announcement

**Posted:** 3 months ago

**Full Content:**

I'm ecstatic to share that ArcPrime has raised $5.1M 🎉 in combined seed and preseed funding, led by early Datadog-backer RTP Global and Rackhouse Venture Capital, with participation from Leonis Capital, Atria Ventures, and leaders from NVIDIA, Meta Superintelligence, Apple, and Braze.

When I was patent counsel at Meta and Fish & Richardson, I kept wondering why so few patents were used strategically. Everyone spent huge amounts on them, projecting $50B+ globally each year, but it wasn't clear what they were for. The theory was clear — "make sure we have patents that read on others" — but no one had time to actually do it.

We're incredibly lucky to live in a world where AI can change that. Even if AI progress stopped today, the tools we already have can dramatically increase the output and strategic leverage of patent counsel by identifying opportunities, surfacing risks, and making decisions that move the business forward.

Thank you to ALL of our customers, including several Fortune 500 companies, for trusting us and helping make this funding possible. We won't let you down.

Now we're building tools to make patents strategically useful instead of just expensive.

If you are a builder who wants to modernize a centuries-old practice area using SOTA tech, we're hiring!

## Post #4 - Patent Attorneys as Hoarders

**Posted:** 7 months ago  
**Impressions:** 8,553  
**Engagement:** N/A  
**Reactions:** 43

**Full Content:**

Many patent attorneys are hoarders. They'd pay any fee to keep a case alive until the bitter end. Ask them why and you'll hear the same thing: "Just in case!" or "But I've spent so much money on it!" Are these strategies or habits?

Even if some attorneys wanted to prune more, the costs are invisible. It's hard to kill something when you don't know what keeping it alive costs, or what else that money could buy.

The mistake isn't not pruning, it's not comparing.

Contribute $50/week into your kid's Roth IRA when they're 5 years old. When they retire, they'll get $2M. Small, consistent actions compound over time.

Same idea with patent renewals. Drip, drip, drip... until you realize you've spent 7 figures keeping weak patents alive.

Here's what good pruning looks like: You drop 10 zombie cases and buy a single patent that actually covers a competitor. You abandon a dead-end tech family and redirect to continuations in areas where people are building real products today.

But to make those trades, you need visibility:

- What are we spending to keep this alive?
- Is it in an over-filed area?
- What else could we be buying instead?
- Where are the gaps in our coverage?

One thing we do know is that patents with 8-12 years of life left have the highest probability of being valuable in licensing (Thanks Richardson Oliver Group). It may be wise to keep patents alive until then assuming the tech still matters.

Anything older, attorneys should consider whether money is better spent on new filings or buying what they need.

This is where ArcPrime comes in. It shows exactly what you're paying, what you're saving, and where you're overexposed. Red means over-filed. You can see how much it is to keep a family alive for the remainder of its lifetime, total lifetime cost, and expensive / hard-to-grant outlier cases.

Letting just 10-15 families with five years left lapse can save $670K-1M+ (see screenshot). This can be enough to buy a litigation-ready patent. Not a bad trade.

The best patent portfolios aren't the biggest. They're the most surgical.

## Post #5 - Hello World

**Posted:** 10 months ago

**Full Content:**

Hello, world. I've been lurking for 20 years. But the problems that excite me now won't let me stay there.

I've always been comfortable pushing technical and legal boundaries but uncomfortable pushing social ones. Solving a nasty bug is way more fun than making small talk.

But I've started to notice something: the truly interesting problems require both building and solving coordination between people (at least for now before AI takes over).

So I started ArcPrime, an IP Legal tech company. People say each time the business needs to level up, I need to level up too. I need to be able to articulate why anyone should care about a cool thing I built. I need to be able to spread ideas through a network of relationships, not just to people that know me. I need to sharpen my thinking by putting ideas out there on the Internet. The company can only grow as much as I'm willing to grow uncomfortable.

I suspect I'm not the only person who finds the transition to publicly use their voice on social media uncomfortable. If you're in a similar place, maybe we can figure it out together.

After all, the most valuable IP might be .... 🤔 ... improved versions of ourselves.

## Post #6 - Outside Counsel Associates

**Posted:** 9 months ago  
**Impressions:** 7,015  
**Engagement:** 6 comments · 1 repost  
**Reactions:** 67

**Full Content:**

When choosing outside counsel, pay attention to the associates. As a former associate, I learned that they don't just support the process; they critically shape it.

Few things are more nerve-wracking than hitting 'send' on a draft you've poured 20+ hours into. If it's off, you question your competence and prepare for the hit on your efficiency (and standing at the firm).

I'd get a mini adrenaline spike whenever I get email from inventors. I'd first read the email Preview: did they say "LGTM", or was I about to spend my weekend rewriting everything?

In my 3rd year, I was tasked to write the first set of patents for Google's AI chips, now called Tensor Processing Units. I was particularly anxious because 1) the technology was state-of-the-art, 2) I billed way more than I should have to just understand the disclosure materials, and 3) it was a high priority focus for Google. Stakes were high.

It turned out well. The engineers were happy. One told me: "Impressive. You understand this better than some engineers on the team."

It's also when I realized: patent quality starts with the associate, not the partner.

As exceptional as my reviewing partner is, he simply didn't have the time to go as deep on the technical details. By the time the partner sees the draft, the groundwork has already been laid.

The associate plants the flag. The initial claims set the boundaries of the patent. Partners might adjust the framing, but full rewrites are rare. You can't easily redraw a map without knowing the terrain. That's why the depth of the associate's understanding is the first outline of the map, and everything else builds from there.

This was one of those "how the sausage is made" moments.

## Post #7 - Writing a Paragraph

**Posted:** 7 months ago  
**Impressions:** 4,966  
**Engagement:** 7 comments  
**Reactions:** 42

**Full Content:**

A partner at a law firm once looked at something I wrote and scolded, "Do you know how to write a paragraph?"

I thought I was better than average given I passed the bar and did well in some college writing courses. Apparently not. I had to relearn the basics: use topic sentences and break ideas into digestible pieces.

But, I also learned that rules should be broken sometimes. I asked that same partner: "Can I make a paragraph just one sentence?" He said, "Why not?"

Why not indeed. I'd assumed paragraphs needed multiple sentences because that's what I saw.

Eventually, I learned that great writing is not about form or diction. Fundamentally, great writing is clear thinking.

The real question is: how do you nudge yourself toward clear thinking?

For me, the key is time. If I want to write something well by a certain date, I have to start early. Let my brain chew on it across several nights' sleep. I always end up changing something.

This creates a virtuous cycle. Clear thinking produces better writing. But writing also produces clarity of thought, which makes you rewrite (clearing out all the fluff), which clarifies your thinking further. The cycle continues until you've written what you actually meant to say.

If anyone has tactics that improved the way you write, please share!

The worst thing about patents is the SLOW feedback loop. The field doesn't evolve quickly, bad policies and inefficiencies linger, and there's almost no room for real experimentation. You can file something today and not learn whether it was worth it for 5-10 years.

Slightly hot take: It's a great time to be a specialist. I used to think generalists had the edge. David Epstein's Range convinced me that breadth beats depth. I even switched from patent counsel to product counsel, hoping that exposure would help me see the bigger picture.
