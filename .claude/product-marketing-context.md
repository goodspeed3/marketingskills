### Primary Personas

| Persona                       | Description                                                      | Main Challenges                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Head of IP**                | Usually the decision-maker. Experiences the most pain.           | Managing budget, streamlining patenting process, doing more with less, getting objective data for decisions          |
| **Head of Patents**           | Decision-maker in smaller teams.                                 | Solving the most urgent high-impact problems — streamlining process, developing quality patents, pruning efficiently |
| **Patent Portfolio Managers** | Manage a product/BU line for patenting and portfolio management. | Sourcing new ideas, improving invention pipeline, deciding what to keep/prune, getting objective data for decisions  |
| **Patent Analysts**           | Specialized roles in larger teams; insights influence decisions. | Portfolio analysis, claims charting, providing decision-support information easily                                   |

### Secondary Personas (Users, NOT marketing targets)

| Persona             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inventors**       | Highest-volume daily users by far. Self-serve submission status and awards status. NOT a marketing target — but inventor satisfaction drives in-house counsel satisfaction, making this a key adoption/retention proof point when selling to decision-makers. |
| **Paralegals**      | Use reporting and signature collection features                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Licensing Teams** | Less of a priority for ArcPrime currently                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Pain Points (Three Mega Themes)

1. **COST/SPEND** — Building and maintaining a best-in-class patent portfolio for less
2. **QUALITY (risk)** — Improving patent quality while reducing internal and external effort
3. **TIME** — Reducing IP spend without increasing risk; eliminating manual work

## Positioning

- **Value proposition**: ArcPrime re-engineers the patent lifecycle with AI — helping IP leaders at hardware and software companies reduce cost, improve patent quality, and save time across every stage from invention intake to portfolio management.
- **Key differentiators**:
  - Built by Patent Counsel for Patent Counsel — deep understanding of AI AND step-by-step patent lifecycle
  - Uses latest AI technology to save cost, time, and enhance quality
  - AI workflows that guide users through each step
  - Complete lifecycle coverage (Pre-Filing, Post-Filing, Post-Issuance) vs. point solutions
  - Network of AI-enabled counsel willing to work at lower cost
- **Competitors**: Anaqua, IPfolio, MaxVal
- **Category**: AI-powered IP/Patent Management Platform

## Brand Voice

- **Personality**: Quietly disruptive, strategic, precise, and confident
- **Tone**: Professional, expert-led, credible — disruption that's thoughtful, not loud or reckless
- **We sound like**: Credible expertise. Intelligent disruption. Cutting through complexity to give IP leaders clarity, control, and better outcomes.
- **We never sound like**: Hype-driven, reckless, dismissive of the professionalism our customers rely on, overly casual
- **Brand essence**: "We combine deep IP expertise with modern AI to challenge how patent work has always been done — without challenging the professionalism our customers rely on."

## Personal Voice (Corey Haines)

Use this voice for LinkedIn posts, emails, thought leadership, and any content written as Corey — not as the ArcPrime brand.

- **Writing style**: Like Paul Graham and Patrick Collison — clear thinking, plain language, substance over style. But more concise, and never "I'm so insightful" tone. No navel-gazing.
- **Sentence length**: Mix of short and long. Short sentences for impact, longer ones when explaining something nuanced.
- **Hooks / openers**: Short and punchy. Lead with the point, not the preamble.
- **Example posts or writing I like**: See `.claude/top-performing-posts.md` for full post history with engagement data

## Value Pillars

### 1. Cost Savings

- **Outside counsel**: Reduced drafting/response costs; long-term vision of complete OC replacement for drafting and OA responses; AI counsel network at lower cost
- **Renewal pruning**: Analyze families and recommend abandonment of narrow/non-detectable/redundant cases
- **Post-filing abandonment**: Identify high-touch outliers for potential abandonment during prosecution
- **Investment decisions**: Predict OA count to determine whether to spend on a case

### 2. Quality Increasing

- AI draft proofreading — checks for missing elements, provides editing suggestions
- Better patent drafting — generates questions to gather missing technical details
- Patent strength assessment — quality score with forward citations and evidence of use
- Litigation readiness — count of high-fidelity assertable patents against competitors
- Claim improvement — continuation targets to improve claim charts

### 3. Time Saved

- Automated invention intake (auto-fill IDF from documents)
- Streamlined workflow (auto-detect case stage from email traffic)
- Inventor signature collection (automated)
- Easy natural-language reporting (valued by paralegals vs. traditional IPMS)

### 4. Inventor Satisfaction (Adoption Driver)

- Inventor self-service for submission status and awards status eliminates constant questions to in-house counsel
- Inventors are the highest-volume daily users of the platform by far — this drives org-wide adoption
- Happy inventors = happy in-house counsel = stronger retention and expansion

## Case Studies / Social Proof

| Client        | Result                                                                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Verily**    | Eliminated manual paralegal work                                                 |
| **Workday**   | AI claim charting up to 200 patents = significant saving                         |
| **Intrinsic** | Improved patent pruning efficiency; increased "actions per minute" significantly |

### Named Prospect Challenges

- **AMD**: Reducing IP spend without increasing risk; improving patent quality while reducing internal and external effort
- **Dropbox**: Demonstrate value in workflows that reduce spend, improve decision-making, support broader portfolio understanding and usage

## Market Context (Gartner & LinkedIn)

- Buyers don't want to speak to anyone until they are **60% along their buyer journey**
- Only **1-4% of the market** are in-market to buy at any given time
- B2B buyers interact **12-16 times** before wanting to speak to someone — regular heartbeat is key

## Messaging Framework

### Messaging Flow

1. **CHALLENGE** — Talk about the challenges (use case studies)
2. **HOW TO SOLVE** — Unique selling points
3. **OFFERINGS/SOLUTIONS** — Solutions available with case studies, ROI, data points

### Patent Lifecycle as Campaign Framework

Each mega theme (Cost, Quality, Time) has a campaign with challenge hooks designed to engage different personas. Micro-challenges align to each lifecycle stage:

- **Pre-Filing** (Ideation & Research): Collating ideas in IDF, what to invest in, how well the patent captures the idea, process too time-consuming
- **Post-Filing** (Patenting & Application): Strengthening patents before it's too late (continuations), developing strong patents quickly, saving on outside counsel
- **Post-Issuance** (Commercializing & Managing): Competitor monitoring, risk management, monetization readiness, portfolio value
- **Maintenance**: Efficient renewals, pruning for cost savings
